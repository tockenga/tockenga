👋 Hi, I’m @tockenga a PhD candidate working at the Cologne Institute for Information Systems which is part of the University of Cologne.

👀 I’m interested in machine learning. Especially ML in NLP, Computer Vision, Music Composition and Financial Trading.

🌱 I am currently working on the following:
- Optimization of layout problems with machine learning methods such as genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning
- Prediction of stock and crypto market regimes with ML
- Object detection of fruits with transformer architectures
- Music/melody generation with deep learning

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all topics listed above
